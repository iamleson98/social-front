## Icon file conventions

- all icons must be svg like icons in this folder
- If there is no icon you want, `Always` refer to https://icon-sets.iconify.design/tabler for available icons. Copy svg content of found icon, then create another file like in this folder. After that, export that icon with meaningful name in file `index.ts`
